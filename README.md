## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- React, JSX
- Hooks, Context, Router
- Session storage
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma for design
- Vercel for deployment

### What I learned

My goal with this project was to just build a React project, as I am learning react currently and could have easily doen it with vanilla JS.I just wanted to continue working, learning, improving, make something tangible with react, and see how I'm progressing. I wanted to focus on keeping components and functions small and clean.

### Continued development

I would like to write more unit tests, starting with this project. I'll likely go back through all my previous apps and add unit tests where I can.
